# Weekly Reports

## Week One
First week has started. A challenge I think I'll encounter is getting back into the mindset and routine of university. The difficulty is also surely going to increase, so to address this challenge, I will try to focus more on course work and avoid getting too distracted. We also presented our world pitches to each other. I could've done a slightly better job by spending less time on one of my slides and having a proper conclusion (trailed off at the end). Will need to rehearse more beforehand.

## Week Two
We did various things this week, such as live coding lectures in comp220, evaluating game UIs in comp210 and comp230 about ethics and professionalism. We also discussed various ideas for our group project with the BAs. Since I'm quite reserved and coupled with the fact that I'm in a new group, I found this slightly challenging and didn't engage as much as I should have. I will try to improve by involving myself more and giving my ideas and thoughts when necessary. 

## Week Three
This week, my biggest challenge was understanding our maths library task for comp220, and how we as a group are going to create our own. I have a feeling this is going to take significant effort and understanding from me, despite this being a collective task, as I don't feel confident with maths in general. 

## Week Four
This week we had a group pitch for our game. The various topics for the pitch were split up, so we all had a chance to contribute by giving our own information on each of our pieces that were later merged into one. A challenge this week for me was the comp210 interview task. It was a mixture of making and using the right questions, finding interviewees and learning HTML for the website itself. I will sit down and work through it thoroughly.

## Week Five
This week I have been trying to find the right research question for the ethics essay task. Despite this being a broad subject, it has been challenging as I keep finding topics many have already written about or will write about. I will have to sit down and do thorough research to address this.

# Week Six
This week was reading week, however I spent most of my time going back and forth between doing personal work and collaborating with the BAs for our group project. Fortunately, our BA group was understanding and told us to take our time and come in when we're done and ready the following week. A challenge I found this week was a more personal one, specifically family related, so this is something I'll have to sort out before it severely affects my performance. 

# Week Seven
This week I've been having issues with Ed's comp220 lecture materials, as I haven't exactly been focusing too much on it as a result of its complexity, so I have some catching up to do.

# Week Eight
This week was the week with our comp230 essay deadline, which I unfortunately spent the whole week doing as opposed to doing it iteratively during past weeks. I managed to submit it in time, however the essay itself could be improved. To avoid crunching issues like this next time, I will avoid distractions and try to write down a schedule regarding this to make it easier for myself.
