# Weekly Reports

## Week One
First week has started. A challenge I think I'll encounter is getting back into the mindset and routine of university. The difficulty is also surely going to increase, so to address this challenge, I will try to focus more on course work and avoid getting too distracted. We also presented our world pitches to each other. I could've done a slightly better job by spending less time on a specific slide and having a proper conclusion (trailed off at the end). Will need to rehearse more beforehand.
