## 5 key challenges across different domains:

### Team communication:
My team communication needs improvement, specifically for our game group project where I need to be more engaged in our discussions. I want to be able to provide different ideas and my opinions in team discussions, rather than depending on ideas already mentioned. I feel my team communication has improved slightly towards the end of the semester, although more can be done. 


### C++ and Java:
I need to work more on my programming knowledge as I still have room for improvement. A more specific example of the language I need to improve is C++. I don't feel like I'm doing enough practice of it. I will improve this both for my course work and so I am able to provide more in-depth assistance to my peers, particularly for our game in our group project. Another language I'll need to take a look at is Java, which will be needed for our next term regarding AI. 


### Prioritising course work:
Prioritising and planning my time better for course work, as I have been falling behind (specifically comp220). Additionally, I need to avoid doing work at the last minute, as experienced with both the recent comp210 and comp230 submissions. I think creating a form of checklist can help with this which will force me to do what I have to do.


### Motivation 
My motivation has been severely cut compared to my first year due to various/personal reasons. This has caused me to stand in a difficult state for this course. I will need to improve this or else it will negatively affect both myself and my peers, pushing myself somehow so I can stop falling behind as I have recently and get back on track. To address this, I will make a diary/personal journal I can write my thoughts, emotions and events in that I can use to improve myself both personally and for this course.


### Reaching out more for assistance:
I told myself at the start of my 2nd year that I would reach out more and use my lecturers for help whenever needed, no matter how small the issues may be. I still have yet to do this, and I am not certain why I find it so difficult to do so. I need to actually understand what I'm doing by for ex. research and looking up tutorials like I always do, as well as actually coding rather than simply following sets of steps from programming tutorials. 


# Weekly Reports

## Week One
First week has started. A challenge I think I'll encounter is getting back into the mindset and routine of university. The difficulty is also surely going to increase, so to address this challenge, I will try to focus more on course work and avoid getting too distracted. We also presented our world pitches to each other. I could've done a slightly better job by spending less time on one of my slides and having a proper conclusion (trailed off at the end). Will need to rehearse more beforehand.

## Week Two
We did various things this week, such as live coding lectures in comp220, evaluating game UIs in comp210 and comp230 about ethics and professionalism. We also discussed various ideas for our group project with the BAs. Since I'm quite reserved and coupled with the fact that I'm in a new group, I found this slightly challenging and didn't engage as much as I should have. I will try to improve by involving myself more and giving my ideas and thoughts when necessary. 

## Week Three
This week, my biggest challenge was understanding our maths library task for comp220, and how we as a group are going to create our own. I have a feeling this is going to take significant effort and understanding from me, despite this being a collective task, as I don't feel confident with maths in general. 

## Week Four
This week we had a group pitch for our game. The various topics for the pitch were split up, so we all had a chance to contribute by giving our own information on each of our pieces that were later merged into one. A challenge this week for me was the comp210 interview task. It was a mixture of making and using the right questions, finding interviewees and learning HTML for the website itself. I will sit down and work through it thoroughly.

## Week Five
This week I have been trying to find the right research question for the ethics essay task. Despite this being a broad subject, it has been challenging as I keep finding topics many have already written about or will write about. I will have to sit down and do thorough research to address this.

## Week Six
This week was reading week, however I spent most of my time going back and forth between doing personal work and collaborating with the BAs for our group project. Fortunately, our BA group was understanding and told us to take our time and come in when we're done and ready the following week. A challenge I found this week was a more personal one, specifically family related, so this is something I'll have to sort out before it severely affects my performance. 

## Week Seven
This week I've been having issues with Brian's comp220 lecture materials, as I haven't exactly been focusing too much on it as a result of its complexity, so I have some catching up to do.

## Week Eight
This week was the week with our comp230 essay deadline, which I unfortunately spent the whole week doing as opposed to doing it iteratively during past weeks. I managed to submit it in time, however the essay itself could be improved. To avoid crunching issues like this next time, I will avoid distractions and try to write down a timed schedule regarding this to make it easier for myself.

## Week Nine
This week I've been working on my VR project for comp220. Finding ideas for one was fun, although personally, involving physical parts into it isn't. I managed to make a mini-game with the FPS template rather than the VR one, as it is compatible with head mount displays. The physical parts are gonna be more of a challenge.


## Week Ten
I've been working on our work with approaching deadlines. Fortunately, again, my BA team was understanding and I used my time on BSc work.


## Week Eleven
This week has been a struggle. I've been focusing on work but it's proven challenging. I have also been absent in some lectures for comp 210 and 220 due to both common and personal reasons, resulting in me falling behind.


## Week Twelve
This is the final week, and I plan on finishing my work and reaching the deadlines. My current top priority is to finish watching the live coding videos, as they will help me progress further with my comp220 task.
