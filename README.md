# -- Most recent (second) term further below --

## 5 key challenges across different domains:


### C++ and Java:
I *still* need to work more on my programming knowledge as I still have room for improvement. A more specific example of the language I need to improve is C++. I don't feel like I'm doing enough practice of it. I will improve this for my course work, so I am able to provide more in-depth assistance to my peers. Another language I'll need to take a look at is Java, which will be needed for our next term regarding AI. I intend to look at Pluralsight tutorials for these two, although not sure which ones specifically yet.


### Prioritising course work:
Prioritising and planning my time better for course work, as I have been falling behind (especially comp220). Additionally, I need to avoid doing work at the last minute, as experienced with both the recent comp210 and comp230 submissions. I think creating a form of checklist can help with this which will force me to do what I have to do.


### Motivation 
My motivation has been severely cut compared to my first year due to various/personal reasons. This has caused me to stand in a difficult state for this course. I will need to improve this or else it will negatively affect both myself and my peers, pushing myself somehow so I can stop falling behind as I have recently. To address this, I will make a diary/personal journal I can write my thoughts, emotions and events in that I can use to improve myself both personally and for this course.


### Reaching out more for assistance:
I told myself at the start of my 2nd year that I would reach out more and use my lecturers for help whenever needed, no matter how small the issues may be. I still have yet to do this, and I am not certain why I find it so difficult to do. I need to actually understand what I'm doing by for ex. research and looking up tutorials like I always do, as well as actually coding rather than simply following sets of steps from programming tutorials. Improving my motivation will also affect this, which will make it easier for me to ask for help rather than shying away and tackling it all myself.


### Team communication:
My team communication needs improvement, specifically for our game group project where I need to be more engaged in our discussions. I want to be able to provide different ideas and my opinions in team discussions, rather than depending on ideas already mentioned. I feel my team communication has improved slightly towards the end of the semester, although more can be done. I'm not sure what more I can do to improve this other than to simply engage myself more and just **do it**. 



# Weekly Reports

## Week One
First week has started. A challenge I think I'll encounter is getting back into the mindset and routine of university. The difficulty is also surely going to increase, so to address this challenge, I will try to focus more on course work and avoid getting too distracted. We also presented our world pitches to each other. I could've done a slightly better job by spending less time on one of my slides and having a proper conclusion (trailed off at the end). Will need to rehearse more beforehand.

## Week Two
We did various things this week, such as live coding lectures in comp220, evaluating game UIs in comp210 and comp230 about ethics and professionalism. We also discussed various ideas for our group project with the BAs. Since I'm quite reserved and coupled with the fact that I'm in a new group, I found this slightly challenging and didn't engage as much as I should have. I will try to improve by involving myself more and giving my ideas and thoughts when necessary. 

## Week Three
This week, my biggest challenge was understanding our maths library task for comp220, and how we as a group are going to create our own. I have a feeling this is going to take significant effort and understanding from me, despite this being a collective task, as I don't feel confident with maths in general. 

## Week Four
This week we had a group pitch for our game. The various topics for the pitch were split up, so we all had a chance to contribute by giving our own information on each of our pieces that were later merged into one. A challenge this week for me was the comp210 interview task. It was a mixture of making and using the right questions, finding interviewees and learning HTML for the website itself. I will sit down and work through it thoroughly.

## Week Five
This week I have been trying to find the right research question for the ethics essay task. Despite this being a broad subject, it has been challenging as I keep finding topics many have already written about or will write about. I will have to sit down and do thorough research to address this.

## Week Six
This week was reading week, however I spent most of my time going back and forth between doing personal work and collaborating with the BAs for our group project. Fortunately, our BA group was understanding and told us to take our time and come in when we're done and ready the following week. A challenge I found this week was a more personal one, specifically family related, so this is something I'll have to sort out before it severely affects my performance. 

## Week Seven
This week I've been having issues with Brian's comp220 lecture materials, as I haven't exactly been focusing too much on it as a result of its complexity, so I have some catching up to do.

## Week Eight
This week was the week with our comp230 essay deadline, which I unfortunately spent the whole week doing as opposed to doing it iteratively during past weeks. I managed to submit it in time, however the essay itself could be improved. To avoid crunching issues like this next time, I will avoid distractions and try to write down a timed schedule regarding this to make it easier for myself.

## Week Nine
This week I've been working on my VR project for comp220. Finding ideas for one was fun, although personally, involving physical parts into it isn't. I managed to make a mini-game with the FPS template rather than the VR one, as it is compatible with head mount displays. The physical parts are gonna be more of a challenge.


## Week Ten
I've been working on our work with approaching deadlines. Fortunately, again, my BA team was understanding and I used my time on BSc work.


## Week Eleven
This week has been a struggle. I've been focusing on work but it's proven challenging. I have also been absent in some lectures for comp 210 and 220 due to both common and personal reasons, resulting in me falling behind.


## Week Twelve
This is the final week, and I plan on finishing my work and reaching the deadlines. My current top priority is to finish watching the live coding videos, as they will help me progress further with my comp220 task. 


# Second Term

## Challenges and SMART Goals:

### Engagement and confidence with my group members.
I felt I did slightly better this year with my team regarding engagement, but more work can be done for my confidence. I realised this from general self-reflection and (especially) from peer reviews/feedback during our PO meetings. Obviously, this is an important trait to have both in the industry and for myself, and I'll work on it by pushing myself even more than I did this year and interact with my fellow members more so we're all on the same page, and lastly by taking more action towards my peers' future feedback about me.

### Organise my tasks and deadlines properly.
I had this challenge last time too, and one of my suggestions was to get a physical calendar which I have unfortunately not done yet as I've been relying on my digital one instead. This has worked, but in order to maximise results I will buy an actual calendar next time our course starts, and use it as much as I can to know where I lie. 

### Push myself more to ask for support.
This is *the* challenge I don't feel I've improved upon, at least not the way I initially planned. I relied heavily on other members for support, which in hindsight I shouldn't have done considering they were often stuck on the same boat as me. This isn't necessarily bad as it can encourage group problem solving, but I should've asked our lecturers more overall for better clarity. For this, I will utilise Slack more to message lecturers in case I can't be there physically, but I will prioritise physical presence. 

### Experiment more, don't be afraid to fail.
A challenge I, for some reason, never considered to be a problem. I often leave work late due to fear of failing it or failing to understand it properly, so as a result I end up doing mediocre quality work and accept whatever the outcome is. In order to learn, failing is necessary and, more often than not, inevitable. To improve this, I'll link this challenge with the 2nd one (Organise my tasks and deadlines properly). The idea is; if I have a clear map of my assignments (in this case my calendar), it'll be easier to know ahead of time when I can or should work on a particular task, which will give me enough time to experiment and therefore improve. 

### Give myself time to clear my thoughts *appropriately*.
Emphasis on "appropriately". I either do lots of work in a set time with no breathing room or do no work for long periods of time until I do. There is no in-between. I believe this is because I tell myself I'll use a particular day only for work, then justify my long breaks after with that reason. This is not healthy, as it increases chances of crunch time and conflicts involving task prioritisation. I need to practice spacing my time appropriately instead of putting everything in one day and barely touching it on the next.  

## Weekly Reports

### Week One
Everyone's back and ready to start the term. The beginnings are usually nice and slow which give us enough time to re-adjust ourselves. My only current worry is the fact that we'll be switching to different languages this term including C# and Java, so I'll have to sharpen my programming.

### Week Two
This week we were introduced to our new modules, and I find them interesting so far. The group game assignments are most likely going to be my favourite as I get to work with things I'm familiar with and find most fun in. One challenge I'll probably encounter is in the comp240 business module, as I'm generally not great with statistics and business-related terminologies. I will have to work on this. 

### Week Three
This week we were shown a client server chat system in our comp260 lecture. I've started looking into MUD multi-dungeon systems and how you would run your own. Overall, it looks like a fun little task with potential to create humorous stories. We also showed our AI proposals, I've realised that I have to work on making a more interesting AI behaviour.

### Week Four
This week I joined other BSc members in the studio and worked on the MUD task, as I haven't done too much of it.

### Week Five
This week we had a couple of peer reviews. We were also provided with a business case template to work off from for our comp240 assignment, which definitely helped.

### Week Six
This week was reading week, and I spent it working on our group game. I would've liked to spend more on BSc work but I also felt I had to help our BA members and at least remind them of my presence.

### Week Seven
This week has been particularly stressful for me as we had to present our business cases. After presenting, I realised I did it wrong as I did not read the business scenario we were provided correctly. Fortunately, our lecturer Gareth redirected me towards the right path, suggesting I try again in video format. His relaxing aura helped de-stress the pressure.

### Week Eight
We had several deadlines this week which I focused on. One of the tasks was for the wiki assignment which I underestimated, resulting in my late contribution. I keep relying on my virtual calendar to keep track of things like these ahead of time, but it is time to get a physical one to make it easier to keep track of my future assignments. 

### Week Nine
Not much this week apart from my mind constantly reminding me of deadlines and work that needs to be done. One of my issues, much like last year, is organising my time wisely and prioritising work that needs finishing. I just need to get with it and continue working.

### Week Ten
This week I've looked into the MicroRTS task and started thinking how to go about it. Not sure why, but this was one of the more difficult ones for me. Another one has to be the server task, as I'm not really sure where to start even after we were showed in lecture. I'll have to dive deeper into these two. 

### Week Eleven
This week I had a slight issue with our game source code assignment as I had to find the core code I added for our mechanics, which were also changed overtime by other members so I had to dive deep. Luckily, I saved and screenshotted some of them beforehand so the problem didn't take as long as it could have.

### Week Twelve
This week I've been focusing on the comp260 server-client task, as I've spent too much time away from it. I'll have to work on getting it to an acceptable level for the submission, which I am hoping to achieve.
