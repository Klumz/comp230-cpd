# Weekly Reports

## Week One
First week has started. A challenge I think I'll encounter is getting back into the mindset and routine of university. The difficulty is also surely going to increase, so to address this challenge, I will try to focus more on course work and avoid getting too distracted. We also presented our world pitches to each other. I could've done a slightly better job by spending less time on one of my slides and having a proper conclusion (trailed off at the end). Will need to rehearse more beforehand.

## Week Two
We did various things this week, such as live coding lectures in comp220, evaluating game UIs in comp210 and comp230 about ethics and professionalism. We also discussed various ideas for our group project with the BAs. Since I'm quite reserved and coupled with the fact that I'm in a new group, I found this slightly challenging and didn't engage as much as I should have. I will try to improve by involving myself more and giving my ideas and thoughts when necessary. 

## Week Three
This week, my biggest challenge was understanding our maths library task for comp220, and how we as a group are going to create our own. I have a feeling this is going to take significant effort and understanding from me, despite this being a collective task, as I don't feel confident with maths in general. 

## Week Four
This week we had a group pitch for our game. The various topics for the pitch were split up, so we all had a chance to contribute by giving our own information on each of our pieces that were later merged into one. A challenge this week for me was the comp210 interview task. It was a mixture of making and using the right questions, finding interviewees and learning HTML for the website itself. I will sit down and work through it thoroughly.

## Week Five
This week I have been trying to find the right research question for the ethics essay task. Despite this being a broad subject, it has been challenging as I keep finding topics many have already written about. I've been having personal family issues recently as well, so this is something I'll have to sort out before it severely affects my performance.
